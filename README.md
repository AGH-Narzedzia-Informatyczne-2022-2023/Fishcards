## Why use Fishcards?

Learning often takes much more time than it could.
It's not surprising - there is **loads** of information 
about various studying techniques. Some people make a living
by teaching others how to learn effectively. Flashcards makes
you use the most efficient, evidence-based studying techniques
without you noticing. And that's powerful!

### 1. Flashcards

They are the basic building blocks of our app. We use them to remember 
and understand a concept. Flashcards make you use the studying techniques
listed below naturally.

### 2. Spaced repetition

Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique. 
When we spread reviews out over time, we tend to forget 
the information much slower. In Fiashcards, we implemented 
an intelligent system that calculates the probability of you 
forgetting information, and then using spaced repetition accordingly.

### 3. Active recall

It's often called the most effective study technique. It
shows that long-term memory is increased when some of the
learning period is devoted to retrieving information from
memory, rather than just remembering. By using Fishcards
you will use active recall in a significant proportion,
especially when using tests.

### 4. Minimizing distractions

Fishcards design is simple and very intuitive. You will not
waste time on figuring out how to use our app nor get
distracted by it's flashy animations. Design is supposed to
be pleasant and evoke positive emotions. We want to 
encourage you to come back often - which is our priority.
