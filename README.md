Web application for smart learning.

Fishcards uses flashcards as its main form of
learning. Our intelligent system tracks what you've already
learned and quickly adapts to the current state of your
knowledge.

## Why use Fishcards?

Learning often takes much more time than it could.
It's not surprising - there is **loads** of information 
about various studying techniques. Some people make a living
by teaching others how to learn effectively. Flashcards makes
you use the most efficient, evidence-based studying techniques
without you noticing. And that's powerful!

### 1. Flashcards

They are the basic building blocks of our app. We use them to remember 
and understand a concept. Flashcards make you use the studying techniques
listed below naturally.

### 2. Spaced repetition

Spaced repetition is an evidence-based learning technique. 
When we spread reviews out over time, we tend to forget 
the information much slower. In Fiashcards, we implemented 
an intelligent system that calculates the probability of you 
forgetting information, and then using spaced repetition accordingly.

### 3. Active recall

It's often called the most effective study technique. It
shows that long-term memory is increased when some of the
learning period is devoted to retrieving information from
memory, rather than just remembering. By using Fishcards
you will use active recall in a significant proportion,
especially when using tests.

### 4. Minimizing distractions

Fishcards design is simple and very intuitive. We don't want you
spend time on figuring out how to properly use our app or get
distracted by it's flashy animations and cool graphics.
